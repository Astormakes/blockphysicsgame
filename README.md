This is a Game that i want to Create to fill a gap of highly technical games with great custommizability ... that also involves making the player completly dependant on his creations ...

i have +5000h in Garrysmod Sandbox and one thing that i always was a little sad about is, that with the physgun and tool gun, im a god. Capable of mopving any Object and solving any Issue myself ... but in games like Spaceengieers that is not the case.

If you crashed a ship and it cant fly on its own amymore, then it and by extension mostlikely you, are stuck and you will have to work on a solution to get you out of that mess. i really liked that baout the game.

But Spaceengineers is missing techical Deph for me personally. I wish to create crazy machines and invent new forms of creating power. Make chemical Reacions or design my own method of transportation. 

The Resolution for example in Minecraft is really corse with its 1x1x1 M blocks so i setout to make my game be based around 20x20x20 cm (8L) blocks... enabling the player to build belivable, scale, usefull and complex Machinery, Vehicles and Devices to aid him in every task imagneable.

This game was started a little out of spite because i see all these awesome concepts in Stormworks but also so much waisted potential. Ive given up on this particular Project because i felt like i was allready mounting technical depth. I unfortenetly lack experiance for Projects of that scale since all my programming efforts have been in microcontrollers or other games where one is seldomly confronted with more then one file that has code in it.

The issue, that i was stuck at was: That the game needs to detect rooms and give them volumes so that the player can use them as storage for dirrefernt liquids and or vessel for chemical reacions. i got that close to working but allrady it was too slow. Allrady this feeled like i have backed myself into a programming corner. I have the hope that this might be starting point or at least a idea spark for someone else to make the game i so desperatly need. Maybe ill start a new one from the ground up trying to use what i lerned from here. And maybe ill have 15 of such attemds till i make something that i like. 

it was the Idea to make it very belivable. Like player does something and then the expected thing happens.

I had all sorts of creazy ideas at the start that would combine and make new concepts:

- Blocks with different properties like weight, since everyblock is 8 liters that means: if its less then 8 KG it floats...
- Pipes that allow liquids and rotation Output from for example an electric motor to be passed along between blocks.
- bigger blocks like engines, electricmotors, gearboxes or heat exchangers, radiators, valves, pumps of variying sizes, pressure detector, temperaturedetectors pipe and volume, pressure switches and may more.
- Pivots, hinges and anlike to create articulated machines and vehicles
- Different liquids that react or behave in different ways.
- Volumes should have temperatures and pressures that also effect the compunds inside.
- liquids cant be compressed gases can always be compressed (and will uncompress) (a player could have the silly idea to make an Air engine and fill up an air tank to insane pressures and use only a bit of it to power a turbine .... like an air battery) maybe i can come up with scenarios where that might be necesarry... like a desert where many liquids instantly evaporate
  - an example would be a room with water >100Â°c should make steam. one water should make 3 steam and "use up heat" to raise the pressure and effectivly work as a steamboiler that could power a turbine.
  - a few example of other liquids or gases: oxygen/liquid oxygen, nitrogen/liquid nitrogen, diesel and diesel vapor, Water and steam, saltwater might deposit saltblocks or something (....) At the end there could be a lot of compounds that have simple temperature dependant rules: if diesel gets too hot it will evaporate create the gas and lower the temperate by a bit for example if diesel gas gets to hot (and oxygen is present) it will create some compound as exhaust and release a lot of it and heat for example.
- Raw oil prosessing for example rawoil heated up makes light oil and heavy oil. light oil can be heated up even further and make diesel and later evaporate and so on... heavly oil be heated into could make sludge .... as like a dead end cemical that can be burned but at low effeciency maybe other chemical pathways also lead to sludge
- Hydraulics: it has reasons its being used for almost everything machinery IRL. Heavy oil can be used for hydraulics
- Heat transfers thought blocks so heat management becomes a thing.
- this game should have survival aspects. (food, dinking clean water)
- "basebuilding" (grids like vehicles can be static too)
- some sort of resource system that enables refining and crafting of blocks.
- inputs and outputs on technicalblocks simelar to wiremod/stormworks/from the Depths.
- curde weather system

i think the previous ones i had in mind when i started but now im feature creeping: maybe these would be for big updates:
- an a somewhat extensive chunkbased weather simulation.
- maybe somesort of wildlife and population simulation. players hungry eat fish. Beat is hungry eat player xD
- for a later major update: seansons? that would afffect lots of things like the wildlife and weather.


im unsure if building per hand and breakable blocks should be a thing... not having them would allow to do all volume calculations and room recignition when the vehicle is spawning in instead of on the fly. Breakable blocks and placing by hand would be sick too though..... and strenghten the survival, resource handling and crafting aspect ... i want to convey the feeling of a harsh enviroment that will kill you if you let it and force the player to really think about how to survive and be paranoid.
