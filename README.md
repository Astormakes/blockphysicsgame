This is a Game that i want to Create to fill a gap of highly technical games with great custommizability ... that also involves making the player completly dependant on his creatins ...

i have +5000h in Garrysmod Sandbox and one thing that i always was a little sad about is, that with the physgun and tool gun, im a god. Capable of mopving any Object and solving any Issue myself ... but in games like Spaceengieers that is not the case.

If you crashed a ship and it cant fly on its own amymore, then it and mostlikely you, are stuck and you will have to work to solve the problem.

But Spaceengineers is missing techical Deph for me personally. I wish to create crazy machines and invent new forms of creating power. Make chemical Reacions or design my own method of transportation. The Resolution for example in Minecraft is really corse with its 1x1x1 M blocks so i setout to make my game be based around 20x20x20 cm (8L) blocks... enabling the player to build belivable, usefull and complex Machinery, Vehicles and Devices to aid him in Rescue Missions, Logistic Tasks or making money.

This game was started a little out of spite because i see all these awesome concepts in Stormworks but also so much waisted potential. Ive given up on this because i felt like i was allready mounting technical depth. I unfortenetly lack experiance for since all my programming efforts have been in microcontrollers or other games where one is seldomly confronted with more then one file that has code in it.

The issue that i was stuck at was that the game needs to detect rooms and give them volumes so that the player can use them as storage for dirrefernt liquids and or vessel for chemical reacions. I didnt get it fast enough to work. This game is probably allready written into a state where is not that easy to work on. I have the hope that this might be starting point or at least a idea spark for someone else to make the game i so desperatly need. Maybe ill start a new one from the ground up trying to use what i lerned from here.

I had all sorts of creazy ideas that would extent or change the way things are done in Stormworks.

- Different liquids that react or behave in different ways.
- Volumes should have temperatures and pressures that also effect the compunds inside.
  - an example would be a room with water with > 100Â°c should make steam. one water should make 3 steam to raise the pressure and effectivly work as a steamboiler that can power a turbine.
