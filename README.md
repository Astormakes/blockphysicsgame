This is a Game that i want to Create to fill a gap of highly technical games with great custommizability ... that also involves making the player completly dependant on his creatins ...

i have +5000h in Garrysmod Sandbox and one thing that i always was a little sad about is, that with the physgun and tool gun im a god capable of doing incredible things ... but in games like Spaceengieers that is not the case.

If you crashed a ship and its and it cant fly on its own amymore, then its stuck and you either have a ship capable of lifting it... or you have to build one.

A thing that Game is missing for me personally is techical Deph. i wich to create crazy machines and invent new forms or creating power. Make chemical Reacions or design my own drivetrain. The Resolution for example in Minecraft is really corse ... enough for a game like Minecraft

but not for one where the player should be able to build complex Machinery and work Machines.

Im on the edge if i should even mention Stormworks here because im afriad that my game is going to look fairy simelar to it, as it is a huge inspiration for it. But i hope i can make it focus more on stuff like Temperatures and chemical REacions within vehicles.

and maybe have the focus less on obnoxious natural desasters and more on belivable tasks xD
